title: 'Lecture 15: Dynamic Programming, Longest Common Subsequence'
transcript: "<p><span m='7000'> So, the topic today is dynamic programming.</span>\
  \ <span m='21000'>The term programming in the name of this term doesn't refer</span>\
  \ <span m='25000'>to computer programming. OK, programming is an old word</span>\
  \ <span m='30000'>that means any tabular method for accomplishing something.</span>\
  \ <span m='35000'>So, you'll hear about linear programming and dynamic</span> <span\
  \ m='39000'>programming. Either of those,</span> <span m='42000'>even though we\
  \ now incorporate those algorithms in computer</span> <span m='47000'>programs,\
  \ originally computer programming, you were given a</span> <span m='52000'>datasheet\
  \ and you put one line per line of code as a tabular</span> <span m='57000'>method\
  \ for giving the machine instructions as to what to do.</span> <span m='64000'>OK,\
  \ so the term programming is older.</span> <span m='67000'>Of course, and now conventionally\
  \ when you see</span> <span m='71000'>programming, you mean software, computer programming.</span>\
  \ <span m='75000'>But that wasn't always the case.</span> <span m='78000'>And these\
  \ terms continue in the literature.</span> <span m='82000'>So, dynamic programming\
  \ is a design technique like other</span> <span m='86000'>design techniques we've\
  \ seen such as divided and conquer.</span> <span m='93000'>OK, so it's a way of\
  \ solving a class of problems rather than a</span> <span m='100000'>particular algorithm\
  \ or something.</span> <span m='103000'>So, we're going to work through this for\
  \ the example of</span> <span m='110000'>so-called longest common subsequence problem,</span>\
  \ <span m='115000'>sometimes called LCS, OK, which is a problem that</span> <span\
  \ m='120000'>comes up in a variety of contexts.</span> <span m='126000'>And it's\
  \ particularly important in computational biology,</span> <span m='130000'>where\
  \ you have long DNA strains, and you're trying to</span> <span m='134000'>find commonalities\
  \ between two strings, OK, one which may be a</span> <span m='139000'>genome, and\
  \ one may be various, when people do,</span> <span m='143000'>what is that thing\
  \ called when they do the evolutionary</span> <span m='148000'>comparisons? The\
  \ evolutionary trees,</span> <span m='151000'>yeah, right, yeah, exactly,</span>\
  \ <span m='153000'>phylogenetic trees, there you go,</span> <span m='155000'>OK,\
  \ phylogenetic trees. Good, so here's the problem.</span> <span m='164000'>So, you're\
  \ given two sequences, x going from one to m,</span> <span m='174000'>and y running\
  \ from one to n. You want to find a longest</span> <span m='184000'>sequence common\
  \ to both. OK, and here I say a,</span> <span m='192000'>not the, although it's\
  \ common to talk about the longest common</span> <span m='199000'>subsequence. Usually\
  \ the longest comment</span> <span m='204000'>subsequence isn't unique. There could\
  \ be several</span> <span m='209000'>different subsequences that tie for that.</span>\
  \ <span m='215000'>However, people tend to, it's one of the sloppinesses</span>\
  \ <span m='221000'>that people will say. I will try to say a,</span> <span m='225000'>unless\
  \ it's unique. But I may slip as well because</span> <span m='231000'>it's just\
  \ such a common thing to just talk about the,</span> <span m='237000'>even though\
  \ there might be multiple.</span> <span m='242000'>So, here's an example. Suppose\
  \ x is this sequence,</span> <span m='247000'>and y is this sequence. So, what is\
  \ a longest common</span> <span m='254000'>subsequence of those two sequences?</span>\
  \ <span m='256000'>See if you can just eyeball it.</span> <span m='275000'>AB: length\
  \ two? Anybody have one longer?</span> <span m='285000'>Excuse me? BDB, BDB.</span>\
  \ <span m='291000'>BDAB, BDAB, BDAB, anything longer?</span> <span m='302000'>So,\
  \ BDAB: that's the longest one.</span> <span m='309000'>Is there another one that's\
  \ the same length?</span> <span m='320000'>Is there another one that ties? BCAB,\
  \ BCAB, another one?</span> <span m='335000'>BCBA, yeah, there are a bunch of them\
  \ all of length four.</span> <span m='340000'>There isn't one of length five. OK,\
  \ we are actually going to</span> <span m='345000'>come up with an algorithm that,\
  \ if it's correct,</span> <span m='349000'>we're going to show it's correct, guarantees\
  \ that there</span> <span m='354000'>isn't one of length five. So all those are,</span>\
  \ <span m='358000'>we can say, any one of these is the longest comment subsequence</span>\
  \ <span m='363000'>of x and y. We tend to use it this way</span> <span m='366000'>using\
  \ functional notation, but it's not a function that's</span> <span m='371000'>really\
  \ a relation. So, we'll say something is an</span> <span m='377000'>LCS when really\
  \ we only mean it's an element,</span> <span m='380000'>if you will, of the set\
  \ of longest common</span> <span m='383000'>subsequences. Once again, it's classic</span>\
  \ <span m='386000'>abusive notation. As long as we know what we</span> <span m='389000'>mean,\
  \ it's OK to abuse notation. What we can't do is misuse it.</span> <span m='395000'>But\
  \ abuse, yeah! Make it so it's easy to deal</span> <span m='400000'>with. But you\
  \ have to know what's</span> <span m='403000'>going on underneath. OK, so let's\
  \ see,</span> <span m='407000'>so there's a fairly simple brute force algorithm\
  \ for</span> <span m='413000'>solving this problem. And that is,</span> <span m='419000'>let's\
  \ just check every, maybe some of you did this in</span> <span m='430000'>your heads,\
  \ subsequence of x from one to m to see if it's</span> <span m='442000'>also a subsequence\
  \ of y of one to n.</span> <span m='451000'>So, just take every subsequence that\
  \ you can get here,</span> <span m='456000'>check it to see if it's in there.</span>\
  \ <span m='460000'>So let's analyze that.</span> <span m='472000'>So, to check,\
  \ so if I give you a subsequence</span> <span m='478000'>of x, how long does it\
  \ take you to check whether it is,</span> <span m='485000'>in fact, a subsequence\
  \ of y? So, I give you something like</span> <span m='494000'>BCAB. How long does\
  \ it take me to</span> <span m='498000'>check to see if it's a subsequence of y?</span>\
  \ <span m='504000'>Length of y, which is order n.</span> <span m='508000'>And how\
  \ do you do it? Yeah, you just scan.</span> <span m='514000'>So as you hit the first\
  \ character that matches,</span> <span m='519000'>great. Now, if you will,</span>\
  \ <span m='521000'>recursively see whether the suffix of your string matches</span>\
  \ <span m='526000'>the suffix of x. OK, and so, you are just simply</span> <span\
  \ m='530000'>walking down the tree to see if it matches.</span> <span m='534000'>You're\
  \ walking down the string to see if it matches.</span> <span m='539000'>OK, then\
  \ the second thing is, then how many subsequences of x</span> <span m='544000'>are\
  \ there? Two to the n?</span> <span m='548000'>x just goes from one to m, two to\
  \ the m subsequences of x,</span> <span m='555000'>OK, two to the m. Two to the\
  \ m subsequences of x,</span> <span m='560000'>OK, one way to see that, you say,\
  \ well,</span> <span m='565000'>how many subsequences are there of something there?</span>\
  \ <span m='572000'>If I consider a bit vector of length m, OK,</span> <span m='575000'>that's\
  \ one or zero, just every position where</span> <span m='579000'>there's a one,\
  \ I take out, that identifies an</span> <span m='582000'>element that I'm going\
  \ to take out.</span> <span m='585000'>OK, then that gives me a mapping from each\
  \ subsequence of</span> <span m='590000'>x, from each bit vector to a different\
  \ subsequence of x.</span> <span m='595000'>Now, of course, you could have matching</span>\
  \ <span m='598000'>characters there, that in the worst case,</span> <span m='601000'>all\
  \ of the characters are different.</span> <span m='606000'>OK, and so every one\
  \ of those will be a unique subsequence.</span> <span m='614000'>So, each bit vector\
  \ of length m corresponds to a subsequence.</span> <span m='622000'>That's a generally\
  \ good trick to know.</span> <span m='629000'>So, the worst-case running time of\
  \ this method is order n times</span> <span m='638000'>two to the m, which is, since\
  \ m is in the</span> <span m='643000'>exponent, is exponential time. And there's\
  \ a technical term</span> <span m='652000'>that we use when something is exponential\
  \ time.</span> <span m='659000'>Slow: good. OK, very good.</span> <span m='663000'>OK,\
  \ slow, OK, so this is really bad.</span> <span m='666000'>This is taking a long\
  \ time to crank out how long the longest</span> <span m='672000'>common subsequence\
  \ is because there's so many subsequences.</span> <span m='677000'>OK, so we're\
  \ going to now go through a process of developing</span> <span m='683000'>a far\
  \ more efficient algorithm for this problem.</span> <span m='687000'>OK, and we're\
  \ actually going to go through several stages.</span> <span m='694000'>The first\
  \ one is to go through simplification stage.</span> <span m='702000'>OK, and what\
  \ we're going to do is look at simply the length of</span> <span m='712000'>the\
  \ longest common sequence of x and y.</span> <span m='719000'>And then what we'll\
  \ do is extend the algorithm to find the</span> <span m='723000'>longest common\
  \ subsequence itself.</span> <span m='726000'>OK, so we're going to look at the\
  \ length.</span> <span m='730000'>So, simplify the problem, if you will,</span>\
  \ <span m='733000'>to just try to compute the length.</span> <span m='736000'>What's\
  \ nice is the length is unique.</span> <span m='739000'>OK, there's only going to\
  \ be one length that's going to be</span> <span m='743000'>the longest. OK, and\
  \ what we'll do is just</span> <span m='747000'>focus on the problem of computing\
  \ the length.</span> <span m='751000'>And then we'll do is we can back up from that\
  \ and figure out</span> <span m='756000'>what actually is the subsequence that realizes\
  \ that length.</span> <span m='763000'>OK, and that will be a big simplification\
  \ because we don't</span> <span m='766000'>have to keep track of a lot of different\
  \ possibilities at every</span> <span m='770000'>stage. We just have to keep track\
  \ of</span> <span m='772000'>the one number, which is the length.</span> <span m='774000'>So,\
  \ it's sort of reduces it to a numerical problem.</span> <span m='777000'>We'll\
  \ adopt the following notation.</span> <span m='780000'>It's pretty standard notation,\
  \ but I just want,</span> <span m='784000'>if I put absolute values around the string\
  \ or a sequence,</span> <span m='789000'>it denotes the length of the sequence,\
  \ S.</span> <span m='793000'>OK, so that's the first thing. The second thing we're\
  \ going to</span> <span m='799000'>do is, actually, we're going to,</span> <span\
  \ m='802000'>which takes a lot more insight when you come up with a problem</span>\
  \ <span m='808000'>like this, and in some sense,</span> <span m='813000'>ends up\
  \ being the hardest part of designing a good dynamic</span> <span m='819000'>programming\
  \ algorithm from any problem, which is we're going to</span> <span m='827000'>actually\
  \ look not at all subsequences of x and y,</span> <span m='833000'>but just prefixes.</span>\
  \ <span m='846000'>OK, we're just going to look at prefixes and we're going to show</span>\
  \ <span m='853000'>how we can express the length of the longest common subsequence</span>\
  \ <span m='860000'>of prefixes in terms of each other.</span> <span m='864000'>In\
  \ particular, we're going to define c of ij</span> <span m='868000'>to be the length,\
  \ the longest common subsequence</span> <span m='874000'>of the prefix of x going\
  \ from one to i, and y of going to one</span> <span m='881000'>to j. And what we\
  \ are going to do is</span> <span m='888000'>we're going to calculate c[i,j] for\
  \ all ij.</span> <span m='896000'>And if we do that, how then do we solve the</span>\
  \ <span m='904000'>problem of the longest common of sequence of x and y?</span>\
  \ <span m='915000'>How do we solve the longest common subsequence?</span> <span\
  \ m='919000'>Suppose we've solved this for all I and j.</span> <span m='923000'>How\
  \ then do we compute the length of the longest common</span> <span m='929000'>subsequence\
  \ of x and y? Yeah, c[m,n],</span> <span m='933000'>that's all, OK? So then, c of\
  \ m,</span> <span m='937000'>n is just equal to the longest common subsequence of\
  \ x and y,</span> <span m='944000'>because if I go from one to n, I'm done, OK?</span>\
  \ <span m='950000'>And so, it's going to turn out that what we want to do is</span>\
  \ <span m='956000'>figure out how to express to c[m,n], in general,</span> <span\
  \ m='962000'>c[i,j], in terms of other c[i,j].</span> <span m='968000'>So, let's\
  \ see how we do that. OK, so our theorem is going to</span> <span m='978000'>say\
  \ that c[i,j] is just --</span> <span m='1025000'>OK, it says that if the i'th character\
  \ matches the j'th</span> <span m='1030000'>character, then i'th character of x\
  \ matches the j'th character</span> <span m='1037000'>of y, then c of ij is just\
  \ c of I minus one, j minus one plus</span> <span m='1043000'>one. And if they don't\
  \ match,</span> <span m='1046000'>then it's either going to be the longer of c[i,</span>\
  \ <span m='1051000'>j-1], and c[i-1, j], OK?</span> <span m='1055000'>So that's\
  \ what we're going to prove.</span> <span m='1058000'>And that's going to give us\
  \ a way of relating the calculation</span> <span m='1064000'>of a given c[i,j] to\
  \ values that are strictly smaller,</span> <span m='1069000'>OK, that is at least\
  \ one of the arguments is smaller of the two</span> <span m='1076000'>arguments.\
  \ OK, and that's going to give us</span> <span m='1080000'>a way of being able,\
  \ then, to understand how to</span> <span m='1085000'>calculate c[i,j]. So, let's\
  \ prove this theorem.</span> <span m='1091000'>So, we'll start with a case x[i]\
  \ equals y of j.</span> <span m='1098000'>And so, let's draw a picture here.</span>\
  \ <span m='1102000'>So, we have x here.</span> <span m='1130000'>And here is y.</span>\
  \ <span m='1153000'>OK, so here's my sequence, x, which I'm sort of drawing as</span>\
  \ <span m='1159000'>this elongated box, sequence y, and I'm saying that</span> <span\
  \ m='1165000'>x[i] and y[j], those are equal.</span> <span m='1178000'>OK, so let's\
  \ see what that means.</span> <span m='1186000'>OK, so let's let z of one to k be,\
  \ in fact, the longest common</span> <span m='1201000'>subsequence of x of one to\
  \ i, y of one to j,</span> <span m='1212000'>where c of ij is equal to k. OK, so\
  \ the longest common</span> <span m='1223000'>subsequence of x and y of one to I\
  \ and y of one to j has some</span> <span m='1229000'>value. Let's call it k.</span>\
  \ <span m='1232000'>And so, let's say that we have some sequence which realizes</span>\
  \ <span m='1239000'>that. OK, we'll call it z.</span> <span m='1242000'>OK, so then,\
  \ can somebody tell me what z of</span> <span m='1248000'>k is?</span> <span m='1264000'>What\
  \ is z of k here?</span> <span m='1274000'>Yeah, it's actually equal to x of I,\
  \ which is also equal to y</span> <span m='1278000'>of j? Why is that?</span> <span\
  \ m='1279000'>Why couldn't it be some other value?</span> <span m='1301000'>Yeah,\
  \ so you got the right idea.</span> <span m='1303000'>So, the idea is, suppose that\
  \ the sequence</span> <span m='1306000'>didn't include this element here at the\
  \ last element,</span> <span m='1310000'>the longest common subsequence. OK, so\
  \ then it includes a bunch</span> <span m='1315000'>of values in here, and a bunch\
  \ of values in here,</span> <span m='1319000'>same values. It doesn't include this\
  \ or</span> <span m='1323000'>this. Well, then I could just tack on</span> <span\
  \ m='1327000'>this extra character and make it be longer, make it k plus one</span>\
  \ <span m='1333000'>because these two match. OK, so if the sequence ended</span>\
  \ <span m='1338000'>before --</span> <span m='1354000'>-- just extend it by tacking\
  \ on x[i].</span> <span m='1360000'>OK, it would be fairly simple to just tack on\
  \ x[i].</span> <span m='1368000'>OK, so if that's the case, then if I look at z\
  \ going one</span> <span m='1378000'>up to k minus one, that's certainly a common</span>\
  \ <span m='1385000'>sequence of x of 1 up to, excuse me, of up to i minus</span>\
  \ <span m='1394000'>one. And, y of one up to j minus</span> <span m='1400000'>one,\
  \ OK, because this is a longest common sequence.</span> <span m='1406000'>z is a\
  \ longest common sequence is, from x of one to i,</span> <span m='1413000'>y of\
  \ one to j. And, we know what the last</span> <span m='1418000'>character is. It's\
  \ just x[i],</span> <span m='1421000'>or equivalently, y[j].</span> <span m='1423000'>So\
  \ therefore, everything except the last</span> <span m='1427000'>character must\
  \ at least be a common sequence of x of one to i</span> <span m='1433000'>minus\
  \ one, y of one to j minus one.</span> <span m='1437000'>Everybody with me? It must\
  \ be a comment sequence.</span> <span m='1444000'>OK, now, what you also suspect?\
  \ What do you also suspect about</span> <span m='1452000'>z of one to k? It's a\
  \ common sequence of these</span> <span m='1458000'>two. Yeah?</span> <span m='1459000'>Yeah,\
  \ it's a longest common sequence.</span> <span m='1466000'>So that's what we claim,\
  \ z of one up to k minus one is</span> <span m='1474000'>in fact a longest common\
  \ subsequence of x of one to i</span> <span m='1482000'>minus one, and y of one\
  \ to j minus one, OK?</span> <span m='1488000'>So, let's prove that claim. So, we'll\
  \ just have a little</span> <span m='1497000'>diversion to prove the claim. OK,\
  \ so suppose that w is a</span> <span m='1509000'>longer comment sequence, that\
  \ is, that the length,</span> <span m='1521000'>the w, is bigger than k minus one.</span>\
  \ <span m='1530000'>OK, so suppose we have a longer comment sequence than z of one</span>\
  \ <span m='1535000'>to k minus one. So, it's got to have length</span> <span m='1538000'>that's\
  \ bigger than k minus one if it's longer.</span> <span m='1542000'>OK, and now what\
  \ we do is we use a classic argument you're</span> <span m='1547000'>going to see\
  \ multiple times, not just this week,</span> <span m='1551000'>which it will be\
  \ important for this week, but through several</span> <span m='1556000'>lectures.\
  \ Hence, it's called a cut and</span> <span m='1559000'>paste argument. So, the\
  \ idea is let's take a</span> <span m='1566000'>look at w, concatenate it with that\
  \ last character,</span> <span m='1575000'>z of k. so, this is string,</span> <span\
  \ m='1579000'>OK, so that's just my terminology for string</span> <span m='1587000'>concatenation.\
  \ OK, so I take whatever I</span> <span m='1596000'>claimed was a longer comment\
  \ subsequence, and I concatenate z</span> <span m='1608000'>of k to it. OK, so that\
  \ is certainly a</span> <span m='1616000'>common sequence of x of one to I minus\
  \ one, and y of one to j.</span> <span m='1631000'>And it has length bigger than\
  \ k because it's basically,</span> <span m='1638000'>what is its length? The length\
  \ of w is bigger than</span> <span m='1644000'>k minus one. I add one character.</span>\
  \ <span m='1648000'>So, this combination here, now, has length bigger that k.</span>\
  \ <span m='1657000'>OK, and that's a contradiction, thereby proving the claim.</span>\
  \ <span m='1663000'>So, I'm simply saying, I claim this.</span> <span m='1667000'>Suppose\
  \ you have a longer one. Well, let me show,</span> <span m='1672000'>if I had a\
  \ longer common sequence for the prefixes where</span> <span m='1678000'>we dropped\
  \ the character from both strings if it was longer</span> <span m='1685000'>there,\
  \ but we would have made the whole thing longer.</span> <span m='1692000'>So that\
  \ can't be. So, therefore,</span> <span m='1696000'>this must be a longest common\
  \ subsequence, OK?</span> <span m='1702000'>Questions? Because you are going to\
  \ need</span> <span m='1707000'>to be able to do this kind of proof ad nauseam,</span>\
  \ <span m='1713000'>almost. So, if there any questions,</span> <span m='1719000'>let\
  \ them at me, people.</span> <span m='1722000'>OK, so now what we have established\
  \ is that z one</span> <span m='1727000'>through k is a longest common subsequence\
  \ of the two prefixes</span> <span m='1735000'>when we drop the last character.\
  \ So, thus, we have c of i minus</span> <span m='1745000'>one, j minus one is equal\
  \ to what?</span> <span m='1751000'>What's c of i minus one, j minus one?</span>\
  \ <span m='1771000'>k minus one; thank you.</span> <span m='1773000'>Let's move\
  \ on with the class, right, OK, which implies that c</span> <span m='1780000'>of\
  \ ij is just equal to c of I minus one, j minus one plus one.</span> <span m='1787000'>So,\
  \ it's fairly straightforward if you think about what's going</span> <span m='1794000'>on\
  \ there. It's not always as</span> <span m='1797000'>straightforward in some problems\
  \ as it is for longest common</span> <span m='1804000'>subsequence. The idea is,</span>\
  \ <span m='1808000'>so I'm not going to go through the other cases.</span> <span\
  \ m='1813000'>They are similar. But, in fact,</span> <span m='1816000'>we've hit\
  \ on one of the two hallmarks of dynamic</span> <span m='1821000'>programming. So,\
  \ by hallmarks,</span> <span m='1824000'>I mean when you see this kind of structure\
  \ in a problem,</span> <span m='1830000'>there's a good chance that dynamic programming\
  \ is going to</span> <span m='1836000'>work as a strategy. The dynamic programming</span>\
  \ <span m='1841000'>hallmark is the following.</span> <span m='1855000'>This is\
  \ number one. And that is the property of</span> <span m='1862000'>optimal substructure.\
  \ OK, what that says is an</span> <span m='1869000'>optimal solution to a problem,\
  \ and by this,</span> <span m='1876000'>we really mean problem instance.</span>\
  \ <span m='1881000'>But it's tedious to keep saying problem instance.</span> <span\
  \ m='1891000'>A problem is generally, in computer science,</span> <span m='1895000'>viewed\
  \ as having an infinite number of instances typically,</span> <span m='1902000'>OK,\
  \ so sorting is a problem. A sorting instance is a</span> <span m='1908000'>particular\
  \ input. OK, so we're really talking</span> <span m='1913000'>about problem instances,\
  \ but I'm just going to say</span> <span m='1919000'>problem, OK? So, when you have\
  \ an optimal</span> <span m='1924000'>solution to a problem, contains optimal solutions\
  \ to</span> <span m='1929000'>subproblems. OK, and that's worth drawing a</span>\
  \ <span m='1937000'>box around because it's so important.</span> <span m='1942000'>OK,\
  \ so here, for example,</span> <span m='1945000'>if z is a longest common subsequence\
  \ of x and y,</span> <span m='1953000'>OK, then any prefix of z is a longest common\
  \ subsequence of a</span> <span m='1975000'>prefix of x, and a prefix of y, OK?</span>\
  \ <span m='1989000'>So, this is basically what it says.</span> <span m='1992000'>I\
  \ look at the problem, and I can see that there is</span> <span m='1996000'>optimal\
  \ substructure going on. OK, in this case,</span> <span m='2001000'>and the idea\
  \ is that almost always, it means that there's a</span> <span m='2006000'>cut and\
  \ paste argument you could do to demonstrate that,</span> <span m='2012000'>OK,\
  \ that if the substructure were not optimal,</span> <span m='2016000'>then you'd\
  \ be able to find a better solution to the overall</span> <span m='2021000'>problem\
  \ using cut and paste. OK, so this theorem,</span> <span m='2029000'>now, gives\
  \ us a strategy for being able to compute longest</span> <span m='2037000'>comment\
  \ subsequence.</span> <span m='2064000'>Here's the code; oh wait.</span> <span m='2078000'>OK,\
  \ so going to ignore base cases in this,</span> <span m='2081000'>if --</span> <span\
  \ m='2144000'>And we will return the value of the longest common subsequence.</span>\
  \ <span m='2154000'>It's basically just implementing this theorem.</span> <span\
  \ m='2162000'>OK, so it's either the longest comment subsequence if they</span>\
  \ <span m='2166000'>match. It's the longest comment</span> <span m='2169000'>subsequence\
  \ of one of the prefixes where you drop that</span> <span m='2174000'>character\
  \ for both strengths and add one because that's the</span> <span m='2178000'>matching\
  \ one. Or, you drop a character from</span> <span m='2182000'>x, and it's the longest\
  \ comment subsequence of that.</span> <span m='2186000'>Or you drop a character\
  \ from y, whichever one of those is</span> <span m='2191000'>longer. That ends up\
  \ being the longest</span> <span m='2194000'>comment subsequence. OK, so what's\
  \ the worst case</span> <span m='2203000'>for this program? What's going to happen\
  \ in the</span> <span m='2212000'>worst case? Which of these two clauses is</span>\
  \ <span m='2220000'>going to cause us more headache? The second clause:</span> <span\
  \ m='2229000'>why the second clause? Yeah, you're doing two LCS</span> <span m='2232000'>sub-calculations\
  \ here. Here, you're only doing one.</span> <span m='2236000'>Not only that, but\
  \ you get to decrement both</span> <span m='2239000'>indices, whereas here you've\
  \ basically got to,</span> <span m='2242000'>you only get to decrement one index,\
  \ and you've got to</span> <span m='2246000'>calculate two of them. So that's going\
  \ to generate the</span> <span m='2249000'>tree. So, and the worst case,</span>\
  \ <span m='2254000'>x of i is not equal to x of j for all i and j.</span> <span\
  \ m='2262000'>So, let's draw a recursion tree for this program to sort of get</span>\
  \ <span m='2272000'>an understanding as to what is going on to help us.</span> <span\
  \ m='2282000'>And, I'm going to do it with m equals seven,</span> <span m='2286000'>and\
  \ n equals six. OK, so we start up the top with</span> <span m='2292000'>my two\
  \ indices being seven and six.</span> <span m='2296000'>And then, in the worst case,\
  \ we had to execute these.</span> <span m='2302000'>So, this is going to end up\
  \ being six, six,</span> <span m='2307000'>and seven, five for indices after the\
  \ first call.</span> <span m='2314000'>And then, this guy is going to split.</span>\
  \ <span m='2317000'>And he's going to produce five, six here, decrement the first</span>\
  \ <span m='2324000'>index, I. And then, if I keep going down</span> <span m='2328000'>here,\
  \ we're going to get four, six and five,</span> <span m='2332000'>five. And these\
  \ guys keep extending</span> <span m='2336000'>here. I get six five,</span> <span\
  \ m='2338000'>five five, six four, OK?</span> <span m='2342000'>Over here, I'm going\
  \ to get decrement the first index,</span> <span m='2348000'>six five, and I get\
  \ five five, six four, and these guys keep</span> <span m='2355000'>going down.\
  \ And over here,</span> <span m='2357000'>I get seven four. And then we get six\
  \ four,</span> <span m='2362000'>seven three, and those keep going down.</span>\
  \ <span m='2367000'>So, we keep just building this tree out.</span> <span m='2373000'>OK,\
  \ so what's the height of this tree?</span> <span m='2378000'>Not of this one for\
  \ the particular value of m and n,</span> <span m='2386000'>but in terms of m and\
  \ n. What's the height of this tree?</span> <span m='2394000'>It's the max of m\
  \ and n. You've got the right,</span> <span m='2401000'>it's theta of the max. It's\
  \ not the max.</span> <span m='2407000'>Max would be, in this case,</span> <span\
  \ m='2410000'>you're saying it has height seven.</span> <span m='2414000'>But, I\
  \ think you can sort of see, for example,</span> <span m='2418000'>along a path\
  \ like this that, in fact, I've only,</span> <span m='2423000'>after going three\
  \ levels, reduced m plus n,</span> <span m='2428000'>good, very good, m plus n.</span>\
  \ <span m='2432000'>So, height here is m plus n. OK, and its binary.</span> <span\
  \ m='2439000'>So, the height: that implies the work is</span> <span m='2445000'>exponential\
  \ in m and n. All that work,</span> <span m='2451000'>and are we any better off\
  \ than the brute force algorithm?</span> <span m='2461000'>Not really. And, our\
  \ technical term for</span> <span m='2465000'>this is slow. OK, and we like speed.</span>\
  \ <span m='2469000'>OK, we like fast. OK, but I'm sure that some of</span> <span\
  \ m='2474000'>you have observed something interesting about this tree.</span> <span\
  \ m='2480000'>Yeah, there's a lot of repeated work here.</span> <span m='2485000'>Right,\
  \ there's a lot of repeated work.</span> <span m='2491000'>In particular, this whole\
  \ subtree,</span> <span m='2494000'>and this whole subtree, OK, they are the same.</span>\
  \ <span m='2500000'>That's the same subtree, the same subproblem that you</span>\
  \ <span m='2506000'>are solving. OK, you can even see over here,</span> <span m='2511000'>there\
  \ is even similarity between this whole subtree and</span> <span m='2518000'>this\
  \ whole subtree. OK, so there's lots of repeated</span> <span m='2523000'>work.\
  \ OK, and one thing is,</span> <span m='2528000'>if you want to do things fast,\
  \ don't keep doing the same</span> <span m='2533000'>thing. OK, don't keep doing\
  \ the same</span> <span m='2537000'>thing. When you find you are repeating</span>\
  \ <span m='2541000'>something, figure out a way of not doing it.</span> <span m='2545000'>So,\
  \ that brings up our second hallmark for dynamic</span> <span m='2550000'>programming.</span>\
  \ <span m='2570000'>And that's a property called overlapping subproblems,</span>\
  \ <span m='2587000'>OK? OK, recursive solution contains</span> <span m='2599000'>many,\
  \ excuse me, contains a small number of</span> <span m='2613000'>distinct subproblems\
  \ repeated many times.</span> <span m='2630000'>And once again, this is important\
  \ enough to put</span> <span m='2634000'>a box around. I don't put boxes around\
  \ too</span> <span m='2638000'>many things. Maybe I should put our boxes</span>\
  \ <span m='2641000'>around things. This is definitely one to put a</span> <span\
  \ m='2645000'>box around, OK? So, for example,</span> <span m='2648000'>so here\
  \ we have a recursive solution.</span> <span m='2652000'>This tree is exponential\
  \ in size.</span> <span m='2655000'>It's two to the m plus n in height, in size,</span>\
  \ <span m='2659000'>in the total number of problems if I actually implemented like</span>\
  \ <span m='2664000'>that. But how many distinct</span> <span m='2667000'>subproblems\
  \ are there? m times n, OK?</span> <span m='2673000'>So, the longest comment subsequence,\
  \ the subproblem</span> <span m='2682000'>space contains m times n, distinct subproblems.</span>\
  \ <span m='2689000'>OK, and then this is a small number compared with two to the</span>\
  \ <span m='2700000'>m plus n, or two to the n, or two to the m,</span> <span m='2707000'>or\
  \ whatever. OK, this is small,</span> <span m='2713000'>OK, because for each subproblem,\
  \ it's characterized</span> <span m='2719000'>by an I and a j. An I goes from one\
  \ to m,</span> <span m='2724000'>and j goes from one to n, OK?</span> <span m='2727000'>There\
  \ aren't that many different subproblems.</span> <span m='2734000'>It's just the\
  \ product of the two.</span> <span m='2736000'>So, here's an improved algorithm,\
  \ which is often a good</span> <span m='2741000'>way to solve it. It's an algorithm\
  \ called a</span> <span m='2745000'>memo-ization algorithm.</span> <span m='2756000'>And,\
  \ this is memo-ization, not memorization because what</span> <span m='2762000'>you're\
  \ going to do is make a little memo whenever you solve a</span> <span m='2769000'>subproblem.\
  \ Make a little memo that says I</span> <span m='2774000'>solved this already. And\
  \ if ever you are asked for</span> <span m='2779000'>it rather than recalculating\
  \ it, say, oh, I see that.</span> <span m='2785000'>I did that before. Here's the\
  \ answer,</span> <span m='2790000'>OK? So, here's the code.</span> <span m='2792000'>It's\
  \ very similar to that code. So, it basically keeps a table</span> <span m='2800000'>around\
  \ of c[i,j]. It says, what we do is we</span> <span m='2804000'>check. If the entry\
  \ for c[i,j] is nil,</span> <span m='2807000'>we haven't computed it, then we compute\
  \ it.</span> <span m='2811000'>And, how do we compute it? Just the same way we did</span>\
  \ <span m='2815000'>before.</span> <span m='2854000'>OK, so this whole part here,\
  \ OK, is exactly what we have had</span> <span m='2865000'>before. It's the same\
  \ as before.</span> <span m='2871000'>And then, we just return c[i,j].</span> <span\
  \ m='2879000'>If we don't bother to keep recalculating,</span> <span m='2883000'>OK,\
  \ so if it's nil, we calculate it.</span> <span m='2887000'>Otherwise, we just return\
  \ it. It's not calculated,</span> <span m='2892000'>calculate and return it. Otherwise,\
  \ just return it:</span> <span m='2898000'>OK, pretty straightforward code.</span>\
  \ <span m='2901000'>OK.</span> <span m='2913000'>OK, now the tricky thing is how\
  \ much time does it take to</span> <span m='2918000'>execute this?</span> <span\
  \ m='2938000'>This takes a little bit of thinking.</span> <span m='2944000'>Yeah?\
  \ Yeah, it takes order MN.</span> <span m='2950000'>OK, why is that? Yeah, but I\
  \ have to look up</span> <span m='2958000'>c[i,j]. I might call c[i,j] a bunch of</span>\
  \ <span m='2965000'>times. When I'm doing this,</span> <span m='2969000'>I'm still\
  \ calling it recursively.</span> <span m='2978000'>Yeah, so you have to, so each\
  \ recursive call is going</span> <span m='2983000'>to look at, and the worst-case,\
  \ say, is going to look at the</span> <span m='2990000'>max of these two things.\
  \ Well, this is going to involve</span> <span m='2995000'>a recursive call, and\
  \ a lookup.</span> <span m='3000000'>So, this might take a fair amount of effort\
  \ to calculate.</span> <span m='3005000'>I mean, you're right, and your intuition\
  \ is right.</span> <span m='3009000'>Let's see if we can get a more precise argument,</span>\
  \ <span m='3013000'>why this is taking order m times n.</span> <span m='3017000'>What's\
  \ going on here? Because not every time I call</span> <span m='3021000'>this is\
  \ it going to just take me a constant amount of work to do</span> <span m='3027000'>this.\
  \ Sometimes it's going to take me</span> <span m='3030000'>a lot of work. Sometimes\
  \ I get lucky,</span> <span m='3034000'>and I return it. So, your intuition is dead\
  \ on.</span> <span m='3041000'>It's dead on. We just need a little bit more</span>\
  \ <span m='3047000'>articulate explanation, so that everybody is on board.</span>\
  \ <span m='3055000'>Try again? Good, at most three times,</span> <span m='3061000'>yeah.\
  \ OK, so that's one way to look</span> <span m='3064000'>at it. Yeah.</span> <span\
  \ m='3065000'>There is another way to look at it that's kind of what you are</span>\
  \ <span m='3069000'>expressing there is an amortized, a bookkeeping,</span> <span\
  \ m='3072000'>way of looking at this. What's the amortized cost?</span> <span m='3075000'>You\
  \ could say what the amortized cost of calculating</span> <span m='3078000'>one\
  \ of these, where basically whenever I call</span> <span m='3081000'>it, I'm going\
  \ to charge a constant amount for looking up.</span> <span m='3084000'>And so, I\
  \ could get to look up whatever is in here to call the</span> <span m='3088000'>things.\
  \ But if it, in fact,</span> <span m='3091000'>so in some sense, this charge here,</span>\
  \ <span m='3095000'>of calling it and returning it, etc., I charged that to my</span>\
  \ <span m='3101000'>caller. OK, so I charged these lines</span> <span m='3104000'>and\
  \ this line to the caller. And I charge the rest of these</span> <span m='3110000'>lines\
  \ to the c[i,j] element. And then, the point is that</span> <span m='3115000'>every\
  \ caller basically only ends up being charged for a constant</span> <span m='3122000'>amount\
  \ of stuff. OK, to calculate one c[i,j],</span> <span m='3127000'>it's only an amortized\
  \ constant amount of stuff that I'm</span> <span m='3131000'>charging to that calculation\
  \ of i and j, that calculation of i</span> <span m='3136000'>and j. OK, so you can\
  \ view it in terms</span> <span m='3139000'>of amortized analysis doing a bookkeeping\
  \ argument that just</span> <span m='3143000'>says, let me charge enough to calculate\
  \ my own,</span> <span m='3147000'>do all my own local things plus enough to look\
  \ up the value in</span> <span m='3152000'>the next level and get it returned.</span>\
  \ <span m='3156000'>OK, and then if it has to go off and calculate,</span> <span\
  \ m='3160000'>well, that's OK because that's all been charged to a different</span>\
  \ <span m='3166000'>ij at that point. So, every cell only costs me a</span> <span\
  \ m='3170000'>constant amount of time that order MN cells total of order</span>\
  \ <span m='3176000'>MN. OK: constant work per entry.</span> <span m='3180000'>OK,\
  \ and you can sort of use an amortized analysis to argue</span> <span m='3184000'>that.\
  \ How much space does it take?</span> <span m='3187000'>We haven't usually looked\
  \ at space, but here we are going to</span> <span m='3192000'>start looking at space.\
  \ That turns out,</span> <span m='3195000'>for some of these algorithms, to be really\
  \ important.</span> <span m='3200000'>How much space do I need, storage space?</span>\
  \ <span m='3203000'>Yeah, also m times n, OK, to store the c[i,j] table.</span>\
  \ <span m='3208000'>OK, the rest, storing x and y,</span> <span m='3210000'>OK,\
  \ that's just m plus n. So, that's negligible,</span> <span m='3215000'>but mostly\
  \ I need the space m times n.</span> <span m='3217000'>So, this memo-ization type\
  \ algorithm is a really good</span> <span m='3221000'>strategy in programming for\
  \ many things where,</span> <span m='3224000'>when you have the same parameters,\
  \ you're going to get</span> <span m='3228000'>the same results. It doesn't work\
  \ in programs</span> <span m='3231000'>where you have a side effect, necessarily,</span>\
  \ <span m='3233000'>that is, when the calculation for a given set of parameters</span>\
  \ <span m='3237000'>might be different on each call. But for something which is</span>\
  \ <span m='3243000'>essentially like a functional programming type of environment,</span>\
  \ <span m='3248000'>then if you've calculated it once, you can look it up.</span>\
  \ <span m='3253000'>And, so this is very helpful. But, it takes a fair amount of</span>\
  \ <span m='3259000'>space, and it also doesn't proceed in a very orderly way.</span>\
  \ <span m='3264000'>So, there is another strategy for doing exactly the same</span>\
  \ <span m='3269000'>calculation in a bottom-up way. And that's what we call dynamic</span>\
  \ <span m='3274000'>programming. OK, the idea is to compute the</span> <span m='3282000'>table\
  \ bottom-up. I think I'm going to get rid</span> <span m='3289000'>of, I think what\
  \ we'll do is we'll just use,</span> <span m='3296000'>actually I think what I'm\
  \ going to do is use this board.</span> <span m='3333000'>OK, so here's the idea.\
  \ What we're going to do is look</span> <span m='3338000'>at the c[i,j] table and\
  \ realize that there's actually an orderly</span> <span m='3345000'>way of filling\
  \ in the table. This is sort of a top-down with</span> <span m='3351000'>memo-ization.\
  \ OK, but there's actually a way</span> <span m='3355000'>we can do it bottom up.\
  \ So, here's the idea.</span> <span m='3360000'>So, let's make our table. OK, so\
  \ there's x.</span> <span m='3367000'>And then, there's y. And, I'm going to initialize</span>\
  \ <span m='3378000'>the empty string. I didn't cover the base cases</span> <span\
  \ m='3388000'>for c[i,j], but c of zero meaning a prefix with no</span> <span m='3399000'>elements\
  \ in it. The prefix of that with</span> <span m='3405000'>anything else, the length\
  \ is zero.</span> <span m='3408000'>OK, so that's basically how I'm going to bound\
  \ the borders here.</span> <span m='3413000'>And now, what I can do is just use\
  \ my formula,</span> <span m='3417000'>which I've conveniently erased up there,\
  \ OK,</span> <span m='3420000'>to compute what is the longest common subsequence,</span>\
  \ <span m='3424000'>length of the longest comment subsequence from this character</span>\
  \ <span m='3429000'>in y, and this character in x up to this character.</span> <span\
  \ m='3435000'>So here, for example, they don't match.</span> <span m='3439000'>So,\
  \ it's the maximum of these two values.</span> <span m='3444000'>Here, they do match.\
  \ OK, so it says it's one plus</span> <span m='3449000'>the value here. And, I'm\
  \ going to draw a line.</span> <span m='3454000'>Whenever I'm going to get a match,\
  \ I'm going to draw a line</span> <span m='3458000'>like that, indicating that I\
  \ had that first case,</span> <span m='3461000'>the case where they had a good match.</span>\
  \ <span m='3464000'>And so, all I'm doing is applying that recursive formula</span>\
  \ <span m='3467000'>from the theorem that we proved. So here, it's basically they</span>\
  \ <span m='3472000'>don't match. So, it's the maximum of those</span> <span m='3474000'>two.\
  \ Here, they match.</span> <span m='3476000'>So, it's one plus that guy. Here, they\
  \ don't match.</span> <span m='3481000'>So, it's basically the maximum of these\
  \ two.</span> <span m='3486000'>Here, they don't match. So it's the maximum.</span>\
  \ <span m='3491000'>So, it's one plus that guy. So, everybody understand how I</span>\
  \ <span m='3497000'>filled out that first row? OK, well that you guys can</span>\
  \ <span m='3503000'>help. OK, so this one is what?</span> <span m='3507000'>Just\
  \ call it out. Zero, good.</span> <span m='3512000'>One, because it's the maximum,\
  \ one, two, right.</span> <span m='3521000'>This one, now, gets from there,</span>\
  \ <span m='3527000'>two, two. OK, here, zero,</span> <span m='3532000'>one, because\
  \ it's the maximum of those two.</span> <span m='3543000'>Two, two, two, good.</span>\
  \ <span m='3555000'>One, one, two, two, two, three,</span> <span m='3574000'>three.\
  \ One, two, three,</span> <span m='3588000'>get that line, three, four,</span> <span\
  \ m='3600250'>OK. One there, three,</span> <span m='3605974'>three, four, good,\
  \ four.</span> <span m='3610000'>OK, and our answer: four.</span> <span m='3614199'>So\
  \ this is blindingly fast code if you code this up,</span> <span m='3623125'>OK,\
  \ because it gets to use the fact that modern machines in</span> <span m='3633275'>particular\
  \ do very well on regular strides through memory.</span> <span m='3645000'>So, if\
  \ you're just plowing through memory across like this,</span> <span m='3650012'>OK,\
  \ and your two-dimensional array is stored in that order,</span> <span m='3655024'>which\
  \ it is, otherwise you go this way,</span> <span m='3658308'>stored in that order.\
  \ This can really fly in terms of</span> <span m='3662802'>the speed of the calculation.\
  \ So, how much time did it take</span> <span m='3671948'>us to do this? Yeah, order\
  \ MN,</span> <span m='3677897'>theta MN. Yeah?</span> <span m='3680769'>We'll talk\
  \ about space in just a minute.</span> <span m='3690000'>OK, so hold that question.\
  \ Good question,</span> <span m='3693875'>good question, already, wow,</span> <span\
  \ m='3696491'>good, OK, how do I now figure out, remember,</span> <span m='3700657'>we\
  \ had the simplification. We were going to just calculate</span> <span m='3706179'>the\
  \ length. OK, it turns out I can now</span> <span m='3709764'>figure out a particular\
  \ sequence that matches it.</span> <span m='3714415'>And basically, I do that.</span>\
  \ <span m='3718000'>I can reconstruct the longest common subsequence by tracing</span>\
  \ <span m='3724932'>backwards. So essentially I start here.</span> <span m='3729474'>Here\
  \ I have a choice because this one was dependent on,</span> <span m='3735928'>since\
  \ it doesn't have a bar here, it was dependent on one of</span> <span m='3742980'>these\
  \ two. So, let me go this way.</span> <span m='3748000'>OK, and now I have a diagonal\
  \ element here.</span> <span m='3753444'>So what I'll do is simply mark the character\
  \ that appeared in</span> <span m='3761222'>those positions as I go this way.</span>\
  \ <span m='3765370'>I have three here. And now, let me keep going,</span> <span\
  \ m='3771203'>three here, and now I have another one.</span> <span m='3776129'>So\
  \ that means this character gets selected.</span> <span m='3783000'>And then I go\
  \ up to here, OK, and then up to here.</span> <span m='3788632'>And now I go diagonally\
  \ again, which means that this character</span> <span m='3795643'>is selected. And\
  \ I go to here,</span> <span m='3798977'>and then I go here. And then, I go up here\
  \ and this</span> <span m='3804724'>character is selected. So here is my longest\
  \ common</span> <span m='3810471'>subsequence. And this was just one path</span>\
  \ <span m='3815098'>back. I could have gone a path like</span> <span m='3817843'>this\
  \ and gotten a different longest common subsequence.</span> <span m='3822203'>OK,\
  \ so that simplification of just saying, look,</span> <span m='3825997'>let me just\
  \ run backwards and figure it out,</span> <span m='3829468'>that's actually pretty\
  \ good because it means that by just</span> <span m='3833989'>calculating the value,\
  \ then figuring out these back</span> <span m='3838026'>pointers to let me reconstruct\
  \ it is a fairly simple process.</span> <span m='3844000'>OK, if I had to think\
  \ about that to begin with,</span> <span m='3850075'>it would have been a much bigger\
  \ mess.</span> <span m='3854962'>OK, so the space, I just mentioned,</span> <span\
  \ m='3859452'>was order MN because we still need the table.</span> <span m='3865264'>So,\
  \ you can actually do the min of m and n.</span> <span m='3872000'>OK, to get to\
  \ your question, how do you do the min of m and</span> <span m='3877970'>n? Diagonal\
  \ stripes won't give you</span> <span m='3881367'>min of m and n. That'll give you\
  \ the sum of m</span> <span m='3885897'>and n. So, going in stripes,</span> <span\
  \ m='3888676'>maybe I'm not quite sure I know what you mean.</span> <span m='3893308'>So,\
  \ you're saying, so what's the order I would do</span> <span m='3898250'>here? So,\
  \ I would start.</span> <span m='3901661'>I would do this one first. Then which\
  \ one would I do?</span> <span m='3906461'>This one and this one? And then, this\
  \ one,</span> <span m='3910246'>this one, this one, like this?</span> <span m='3912923'>That's\
  \ a perfectly good order. OK, and so you're saying,</span> <span m='3918000'>then,\
  \ so I'm keeping the diagonal there all the time.</span> <span m='3922800'>So, you're\
  \ saying the length of the diagonal is the min of m and</span> <span m='3928615'>n?\
  \ I think that's right.</span> <span m='3931633'>OK, there is another way you can\
  \ do it that's a little bit</span> <span m='3936068'>more straightforward, which\
  \ is you compare m to n.</span> <span m='3939881'>Whichever is smaller, well, first\
  \ of all,</span> <span m='3942993'>let's just do this existing algorithm.</span>\
  \ <span m='3945871'>If I just simply did row by row, I don't need more than a</span>\
  \ <span m='3950228'>previous row. OK, I just need one row at a</span> <span m='3953418'>time.\
  \ So, I can go ahead and compute</span> <span m='3956141'>just one row because once\
  \ I computed the succeeding row,</span> <span m='3960421'>the first row is unimportant.\
  \ And in fact,</span> <span m='3964910'>I don't even need the whole row.</span>\
  \ <span m='3967263'>All I need is just the current row that I'm on,</span> <span\
  \ m='3970754'>plus one or two elements of the previous row,</span> <span m='3974093'>plus\
  \ the end of the previous row.</span> <span m='3976522'>So, I use a prefix of this\
  \ row, and an extra two elements,</span> <span m='3980848'>and the suffix of this\
  \ row. So, it's actually,</span> <span m='3984263'>you can do it with one row, plus\
  \ order one element.</span> <span m='3988058'>And then, I could do it either running\
  \ vertically or running</span> <span m='3992535'>horizontally, whichever one gives\
  \ me the</span> <span m='3995495'>smaller space. OK, and it might be that your</span>\
  \ <span m='4000303'>diagonal trick would work there too.</span> <span m='4003084'>I'd\
  \ have to think about that. Yeah?</span> <span m='4005785'>Ooh, that's a good question.\
  \ So, you can do the calculation</span> <span m='4010392'>of the length, and run\
  \ row plus order one</span> <span m='4013570'>elements. OK, and our exercise,</span>\
  \ <span m='4017415'>and this is a hard exercise, OK, so that a good one to do is</span>\
  \ <span m='4024203'>to do small space and allow you to reconstruct the LCS because</span>\
  \ <span m='4031221'>the na\xD4ve way that we were just doing it, it's not clear\
  \ how you</span> <span m='4038469'>would go backwards from that because you've lost\
  \ the</span> <span m='4044336'>information. OK, so this is actually a very</span>\
  \ <span m='4049168'>interesting and tricky problem. And, it turns out it succumbs</span>\
  \ <span m='4057182'>of all things to divide and conquer, OK, rather than some</span>\
  \ <span m='4063329'>more straightforward tabular thing.</span> <span m='4067060'>OK:\
  \ so very good practice, for example,</span> <span m='4071231'>for the upcoming\
  \ take home quiz, OK, which is all design</span> <span m='4077268'>and cleverness\
  \ type quiz. OK, so this is a good one for</span> <span m='4083493'>people to take\
  \ on. So, this is basically the</span> <span m='4087191'>tabular method that's called\
  \ dynamic programming.</span> <span m='4091319'>OK, memo-ization is not dynamic\
  \ programming, even though it's</span> <span m='4096479'>related. It's memo-ization.</span>\
  \ <span m='4098714'>And, we're going to see a whole bunch of other problems that</span>\
  \ <span m='4103788'>succumb to dynamic programming approaches.</span> <span m='4107314'>It's\
  \ a very cool method, and on the homework,</span> <span m='4111098'>so let me just\
  \ mention the homework again.</span> <span m='4116000'>On the homework, we're going\
  \ to look at a</span> <span m='4118216'>problem called the edit distance problem.</span>\
  \ <span m='4120434'>Edit distance is you are given two strings.</span> <span m='4122763'>And\
  \ you can imagine that you're typing in a keyboard with one of</span> <span m='4126256'>the\
  \ strings there. And what you have to do is by</span> <span m='4128862'>doing inserts,\
  \ and deletes,</span> <span m='4130303'>and replaces, and moving the cursor around,</span>\
  \ <span m='4132631'>you've got to transform one string to the next.</span> <span\
  \ m='4135182'>And, each of those operations has a cost.</span> <span m='4137399'>And\
  \ your job is to minimize the cost of transforming the one</span> <span m='4140671'>string\
  \ into the other. This actually turns out also to</span> <span m='4145565'>be useful\
  \ for computational biology applications.</span> <span m='4149537'>And, in fact,\
  \ there have been editors,</span> <span m='4152600'>screen editors, text editors,</span>\
  \ <span m='4154917'>that implement algorithms of this nature in order to minimize</span>\
  \ <span m='4159881'>the number of characters that have to be sent as IO in and out</span>\
  \ <span m='4164931'>of the system. So, the warning is,</span> <span m='4168568'>you\
  \ better get going on your programming on problem one on</span> <span m='4173274'>the\
  \ homework today if at all possible because whenever I</span> <span m='4177816'>assign\
  \ programming, since we don't do that as sort</span> <span m='4181862'>of a routine\
  \ thing, I'm just concerned for some</span> <span m='4185660'>people that there\
  \ will not be able to get things like the</span> <span m='4190283'>input and output\
  \ to work, and so forth.</span> <span m='4193422'>We have example problems, and\
  \ such, on the website.</span> <span m='4197550'>And we also have, you can write\
  \ it in any</span> <span m='4200853'>language you want, including Matlab,</span>\
  \ <span m='4203743'>Python, whatever your favorite, the solutions will be written</span>\
  \ <span m='4208697'>in Java and Python. OK, so the fastest solutions</span> <span\
  \ m='4214425'>are likely to be written in c. OK, you can also do it in</span> <span\
  \ m='4219188'>assembly language if you care to.</span> <span m='4221960'>You laugh.\
  \ I used to be in assembly</span> <span m='4224905'>language programmer back in\
  \ the days of yore.</span> <span m='4228716'>OK, so I do encourage people to get\
  \ started on this because let</span> <span m='4234086'>me mention, the other thing\
  \ is that this particular problem on</span> <span m='4239370'>this problem set is\
  \ an absolutely mandatory problem.</span> <span m='4245000'>OK, all the problems\
  \ are mandatory, but as you know you</span> <span m='4249662'>can skip them and\
  \ it doesn't hurt you too much if you only</span> <span m='4254583'>skip one or\
